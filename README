== DESCRIPTION:

A generic from source port installation system written in ruby.

== HISTORY:

Explosive growth of git usage, particularly in the ruby community lead to the
requirement for a software distribution platform supporting source
repositories for tracking 'edge' code during the appropriate stages of
development.

During discussions on desires for additions to rubygems, and the idea of
potentially rebuilding rubygems in a miniaturised form, I stumbled upon an
idea to (ab)use existing code version management infrastructure as part of my
normal library management routines.

I later realised the extent of what I had built. By opening up the spec to
allow more version control systems than just git, and by leaving the .port
build configurations relatively agnostic I had built a generic deployment /
software configuration platform.

By adding new repositories, private or public, it is possible to utilise this
platform as a full deployment and developer environment management solution.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Supports as many platforms as ruby does!

* FIXME (list of features or problems)

== TODO:

* Complete spec coverage - stab case went a little too far!
* Add versioning support
* Add support for gitosis repositories (with search?)
* Project vendoring support
* Add discovery of plugins / extensions / hooks
* Add discovery of repositories

== Mid Range TODO:

Probably as plugins:
* Add support for rubygems
* Add support for macports
* Add support for pkgsrc
* Add support for freebsd ports
* Add support for openbsd ports
* Add support for packages for the ports / pkgsrc systems
* Add support for aptitude
* Add support for pacman
* Add support for portage / emerge

== Long Range TODO:

* Add support for platform pre-builds
  - .sh, .bat, maybe some static helpers
  - add ruby build
* Integrate into / around luis mingw scripts

== SYNOPSIS:

  sourceport install 'eventmachine'
  
  sourceport search 'bacon'

  FIXME (code sample of usage)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby
* /usr/bin/env # For web installs
* Git # For web installs
* Bacon # For specs - can be auto installed

== INSTALL:

* ruby -ropen-uri -e 'open("http://github.com/raggi/source_ports/tree/stable/install.rb?raw=true") { |f| eval(f.read) }'
